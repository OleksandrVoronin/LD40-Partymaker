Theme: The more you have, the worse it is
https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/party-maker
 
### Controls
- WASD - move 
- hold 'shift' - run
- 'space' - hit
- 'f' - interact

### Goals
Well, look at your fancy self at this amazing party over here woaaah. 
I guess it would be a good idea to grab a drink or something and see how the night goes ;p

### Hints
You have to keep yourself intoxicated or you'll start losing health.
The more intoxicated you are - the more point you get.. and you also demand more drinks too :p

psssst try attacking lonely people because if there's someone around them there's a chance they'll join in the wrestle.

### Tools used
- Unity engine 
- Blender for modeling of all the objects in game and animating the main character.. only character and all his clones ;p
- Mixamo for rigging bc I suck at rigging myself
- GIMP for texturing and whatnot 
- FL Studio 12 for music and SFX
